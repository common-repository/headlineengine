## Features

### Readability

We use the [Flesch Kincaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) formula to calculate readability. A good range of not too complex or too simple would be between 45 and 90. This is configurable in the system.

### Length

You should aim for a letter count in the low-80s, which is about 12 words. We recommend between 40 and 90 characters. This is configurable in the system.

### Powerwords

Powerwords are emotional words. You can set your own, or use the words from [RankMath](https://rankmath.com/blog/power-words/).
